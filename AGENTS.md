## Repository identity

This repository is a **ubiquitous automation substrate**.

Treat `docs/REPOSITORY_CHARTER.md` as the canonical ownership and placement contract.

### Non-negotiable execution rules

- Keep core automation repository-, domain-, platform-, and consumer-agnostic.
- Isolate repository/provider/domain-specific behavior behind adapters, integrations, profiles, manifests, or configuration.
- Do not hard-code one consuming repository's paths, schemas, naming, credentials, product assumptions, or release lifecycle into shared core logic.
- Prefer deterministic machine-readable inputs, outputs, schemas, manifests, and receipts.
- Never commit secrets, authenticated browser profiles, cookies, tokens, or private runtime state.
- Reuse existing contracts and helpers before creating competing mechanisms.
- If a proposed feature is inseparable from one product's business logic, leave it with that product instead of contaminating this repository's core.
- Do not claim universal compatibility beyond observed validation.

Before substantial mutation, read `docs/REPOSITORY_CHARTER.md` and preserve these invariants.
